# WordPress is not WordPress.com
A tiny progressive web app outlining the differences between WordPress and WordPress.com

## What is this?

Mainly an [exercise](https://glueckpress.com/8535/pwa/) in how to make a very, very small progressive web app. You can see it live here:

[wpisnotwp.com](https://wpisnotwp.com/)

## Can I contribute?

Sure! If you wish to contribute content or code, feel free [open and issue](https://github.com/glueckpress/wpistnotwp.com/issues) and or [send a pull request](https://github.com/glueckpress/wpistnotwp.com/pulls).

## I donâ€™t see any build tools.

Right, Iâ€™m not very much into those. And while I have nothing against build tools in general, I donâ€™t feel like adding a dozen of extra files just to update a single HTML document.

## Is this a community project?

It has not started out as one, but since it saw its [first contribution](https://github.com/glueckpress/wpistnotwp.com/releases/tag/1.0.1) from a community person, itâ€™s probably fair to say it is. ðŸ˜‰

It definitely is not part of the WordPress.org or WordPress.com platforms.

## How can I get in touch?

Ping @glueckpress on the WordPress Slack.
